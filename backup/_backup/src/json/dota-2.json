Midlaners often aim to gain an advantage in solo confrontations and level up quickly to have an active impact on the game.\n\n• Position 3 - Off Lane: Plays on the offlane (hard lane). These players usually focus on disrupting the enemy’s strategy and surviving under tough conditions, often taking on the role of an initiator or a tank.\n\n• Position 4 - Support: Also known as the roaming support. Players in this role often move around the map, assisting their team in securing early advantages.\n\n• Position 5 - Hard Support: Requires fewer resources and is focused on supporting the team, placing wards, and healing allies.",
