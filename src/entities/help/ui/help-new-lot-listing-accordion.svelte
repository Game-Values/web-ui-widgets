                    Your title should be straightforward and reflect the main content of the item.
                    For example, <q>Dota 2 Account 7000mmr with Baby Roshan</q>

                    Specify all important characteristics of the item. If it's a game
                    account, mention the character level, main achievements, rare items, etc.

                    Photos should be high quality and reflect the current condition of the
                    item. If selling a game account, add screenshots of inventory, character stats, and other key
                    features.

                    If the item has any flaws or limitations, be sure to mention them in the
                    description. This will save both your and the buyer's time and reduce the risks of
                    dissatisfaction after the purchase.

                    Research the market and set a price that matches the quality and
                    rarity of your item, but is also competitive.

                    </mark>

                    If your item has been on sale for a long time, consider
                    offering a temporary discount or promotion to attract attention.
                    Update the Description: If the item does not sell for a long time,
                    it may be worth updating or changing the description, adding new information,
                    or highlighting the key benefits of the item.

                    Avoid writing a description that's only a few characters long or misleading.
                    Ensure the description is comprehensive so the buyer is not misled about

                    Do not post photos that do not correspond to your actual item.

                    Refrain from listing the same item multiple times.
                    Duplicates created for the purpose of price undercutting will be removed,
